            In crypto, ambitious promises often come long before real products, creating justified skepticism.
            InterLink took a different path. In just nine months during 2025, it quietly built a massive,
            engaged, and functional ecosystem. Below are the four defining takeaways from its first year.

    <tr>
        <td colspan="2" style="padding:22px; line-height:1.8;">
            Since launching on March 30, 2025, InterLink scaled to over 5.2 million verified users,
            known as “Human Nodes,” with nearly 3 million daily active participants across 131 countries.
            This scale effectively solved the Web3 cold-start problem, unlocking real network effects.
            Such rapid, global adoption is rare and signals strong demand for verified digital identity.

    <tr>
        <td colspan="2" style="padding:22px; line-height:1.8;">
            Rather than launching a token first, InterLink delivered a full ecosystem in 2025:
            a live DEX, the ITLX Super Wallet, a real-world Visa Card, and a transparent Blockchain Explorer.
            Its dual-token structure separates community incentives from institutional reserves,
            reinforcing a deliberate commitment to adoption over speculation.

    <tr>
        <td colspan="2" style="padding:22px; line-height:1.8;">
            InterLink secured backing and recognition from outside traditional crypto circles:
            Google became a lead investor, AWS provided AI infrastructure support,
            and NIST ranked its Human-AI model among the world’s top 113.
            Additionally, multiple companies committed to holding InterLink tokens
            as treasury assets before any public exchange listing.

            InterLink’s core mission centers on Proof of Personhood.
            With the launch of the Human Credit Score (HCS) in November 2025,
            the network introduced AI-powered verification to reduce bots,
            scams, and fake participation—addressing a foundational problem
            across the entire digital ecosystem.

            <strong>Conclusion — A New Blueprint for Web3?</strong><br><br>
            A clear mission attracted real users. Real users justified real products.
            Real products earned institutional trust. InterLink’s execution in 2025
            outlines a rare, disciplined flywheel—one that may redefine how
            trust, identity, and value are built online.
